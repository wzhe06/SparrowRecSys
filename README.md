# Sparrow Recommender System (English Version)

## Introduction of SparrowRecSys

Sparrow Recommender System (SparrowRecSys) is a movie recommender system, the name SparrowRecSys, is taken from the meaning of "one sparrow is small, but has all the internal organs". The project is a maven-based mixed language project, which also includes different modules of recommendation systems such as TensorFlow, Spark, and Jetty Server. I hope readers can use SparrowRecSys to learn about recommender systems and have the opportunity to improve it together.

## Practical Lessons based on SparrowRecSys (Original Version)

Invited by Geek Time to offer the [Deep Learning Recommendation System Combat](http://gk.link/a/10lyE) course, which explains all the technical details of SparrowRecSys in detail, covering deep learning model structure, model training, feature engineering, Modules such as model evaluation, model online service and recommendation server internal logic.

## Environment Setup and Dependencies

- Java 8
- Scala 2.11
- Python 3.6+
- TensorFlow 2.0+

## Quick Start

After opening the project with `IntelliJ IDEA`, find `RecSysServer`, right-click `Run`, and then enter `http://localhost:6010/` in the browser to see the front-end effect of the recommendation system.

## Project Data Source

The project data comes from the open-source movie dataset [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/). The MovieLens dataset is simplified by the project's own dataset, and only 1000 movies and related comments and user data are retained. . Please download the full dataset from the official MovieLens website. MovieLens 20M Dataset is recommended.

## SparrowRecSys Technical Architecture

The technical architecture of SparrowRecSys follows the classic industrial-level deep learning recommendation system architecture, including multiple modules such as offline data processing, model training, near-line stream processing, online model service, and front-end recommendation result display. The following is the architecture diagram of SparrowRecSys:
